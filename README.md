# Video Tube Timeline React and Material UI Project

Here we simulate you tube with small scale approach just to show the main page that shows the feed and on the left side you got the choices of types you wanna see.
Also we have the search  that works really fine.
Not that only but also we have the page that allow you to see the video with some details like likes and no. view.


To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`


This is only achieved with the techlogies of:
1-React Logic (useState,useEffect,useRef):
2-Material UI Css.
3-React JSX of HTML.
4-Axios for Get Request.
5-RapidAPI - youtube v3.
