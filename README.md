# Video Tube Timeline React and Material UI Project

Here we simulate you tube with small scale approach just to show the main page that shows the feed and on the left side you got the choices of types you wanna see.
Also we have the search  that works really fine.
Not that only but also we have the page that allow you to see the video with some details like likes and no. view.

This is only achieved with the techlogies of:
1-React (useState,useEffect,useRef):
2-Pure Css.
3-JSX of HTML.
4-Backend preArranged Youtube fake API.
